  "description": "Introduces a tier system and better effect scaling for beacons\n- Adds night vision, fire resistance, §onutrition§r, §olong reach§r, and slow falling as beacon effects\n- Adds a tier system for beacons, with diamond and netherite structures providing progressively increased effect potency\n- Adds a higher potency of night vision, allowing the player to see everything with midday lighting (full bright) and no fog effects\n- Adds 2 new effects to the game, Long Reach, increasing interaction reach, and Nutrition, passively restoring food levels\n- Adds a dropping mechanic to slow falling, allowing sneaking to cause a fall at normal velocity whilst still negating damage\n- Adds an increased step height to jump boost, allowing the player to step up blocks instantaneously when the effect is applied §8(Note: Auto-jump takes precedence, and will need to be disabled for this to have any effect)§r",
