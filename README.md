# Beacon Overhaul

**A mod for Minecraft that introduces a tier system and better effect scaling for beacons**

- Adds night vision, fire resistance, *nutrition*, *long reach*, and slow falling as beacon effects
- Adds a tier system for beacons, with diamond and netherite structures providing progressively increased effect potency
- Adds a higher potency of night vision, allowing the player to see everything with midday lighting (full bright) and no fog effects
- Adds 2 new effects to the game, Long Reach, increasing interaction reach, and Nutrition, passively restoring food levels

*In future releases higher potency night vision, long reach, and nutrition may be separated into other mods for modularity.*

**The latest version of this mod requires Minecraft 1.17 Pre-Release 1 or newer**
