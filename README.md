# Beacons

**An overhaul to beacons, introducing a tier system and better effect scaling!**

- Adds night vision, fire resistance, long reach (see below), and slow falling as beacon effects
- Adds a tier system for beacons, with diamond and netherite structures providing progressively increased effect potency
- Adds a higher potency of night vision, allowing the player to see everything with midday lighting (full bright) and no fog effects
- Adds a new effect, Long Reach, allowing for further block reach, available on level 4 beacons

*In future releases, higher potency night vision and long reach may be separated into other mods for modularity.*
